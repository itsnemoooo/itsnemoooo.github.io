## The Chicago Booth approach to marketing.

"trust me I've been doing it for 20 years." is now...
"trust me I did a pilot study and here's how we collected the data."

- What is your theory? Articulate it.
- What is your evidence? What are we looking for in the data?
  - Which data/methods?
- Was it good for business (accountability/evaluation)?
  - Be accountable for what the money was spent on.

## Where does AI fit in?
AI is a tool. It is narrow. We've got some time before AGI.
Set expectations accordingly.

## Applications:
- Price optimisation. Ex: Ziprecruiter. 
Solves the problem of: "Why are we chargint this price? Because that's how we always have."
If I don't know demand, how do we know the price is good.
If we haven't changed the price how can we know anything about demand.

## Microeconomics
### DEMND CURVE:
They collected conversion % by price. The data tells us demand.
Think in terms of price elasticity of demand.
I could increase my price by a factor of X and I would lose Y% of my customers.
### PRICING FUNCTION:
Take the graph and multiply by the price (Expected profit). Revenue per lead on the y, price on the x.

## What can we do with the data?

When we use one price for a customer population there will almost always be people we are excluding.
Missed opportunity can be quantified.

Can we classify customers by where they should be on the demand curve?
Goal is to capture all the profits under the demand curve.

| **Company/Job Variable**           |
|------------------------------------|
| Job State                          |
| Company Type                       |
| Has Commissions                    |
| Company Declared Job Slots Needed  |
| Job Total Benefits                 |
| Employment Type                    |
| Resume Required                    |
| Job Medical Benefit                |
| Job Vision Benefit                 |
| Job Life Insurance Benefit         |
| Job Category                       |

Take this data and convert it into a willigness to pay estimate with ML.
We can't run regression as there are too many categories.

### 3-bin experiment: control, uniform, personalised pricing.

| **Pricing**     | **Projected Profit per Lead** | **Realised Profit per Lead** |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Base (£99)      | £25                           | £23                          |
| Uniform (£249)  | £40                           | £38                          |
| Personalised    | £44                           | £42                          |

How do we measure success?What percentage revenue improvement?

So what about GenAI?
