# Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. 

I'm an American ML engineer based in London. I have a background in EE, networks and I am looking forward to exploring the intersection of ML and the physical world.

It is my hope that this will serve as a useful reference and ignite conversations towards collaboration.

### some quotes I like
```
- All models are wrong, but some are useful. - George E.P. Box
- I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers 
that can't be questioned. - Richard Feynman
```
