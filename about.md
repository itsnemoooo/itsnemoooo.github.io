# Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. 

I'm an American ML engineer based in London. I have a background in EE, networks and I am looking forward to exploring the intersection of ML and the physical world.

I started this journal to document my thoughts and projects as I explore the world of ML. 

It is my hope that this will serve as a useful reference and ignite conversations towards collaboration.
